CP320 Exploration Project - RFID reader with database support
By: Aayush Sheth & Michael Pintur 

## Overview
  We used a Parralax RFID with a sqlite3 database to simulate a room security system. We first start by storing RFID cards into the database either as a user with access or as banned user. When a user who has been added into the database with access scans their card, a bi-color LED will turn green indicating that the user has access. While when a banned user scans their card the LED will flicker red, and a 5v buzzer will go off.  When a user who has not been added to the database tries to scan their card, the LED will turn red alongside the buzzer to indicate that the user cannot enter.
